## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Siddharth Mishra. I absolutely love creating things. I've been writing code since I was in grade 2, slowly moving from LOGO -> HTML -> Java -> Python -> C++ -> C (finally!), while exploring other languages like Rust, Haskell, OCaml, etc... I love the idea of functional programming as well. By the time you're reading this, maybe I have some notes on lambda calculus on my blog [brightprogrammer.in](https://brightprogrammer.in).

I currently support myself by taking contract works, providing consultancy, both by legal agreements, and by word of mouth (depending on whether I know you or not). I'm open to any technical discussion on my self hosted Mattermost server [chat.brightprogrammer.in](https://chat.brightprogrammer.in).

I like low level programming, have done some reverse engineering, pwning, graphics programming, web development, desktop app development, and what not? I'd call myself _Jack of all trades_, and in pursuit of being _Master of all_! I've written grammar based fuzzers, operating system, parsers, a website completely C (yes, html was in C as well!), small games, small graphics programs to render shapes by loading 3d models from files, http servers, api backends (in C again, but in Python as well...), and most of this is from scratch.

These are my only original accounts :

- [LinkedIn](https://in.linkedin.com/brightprogrammer)

If you find my go-to handle (brightprogrammer) anywhere else, that's not me!
